# WIX1002 (Fundamentals of Programming)

[WIX1002](https://spectrum.um.edu.my/course/info.php?id=151) is a core course introduced to Year 1 students in the [Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (FCSIT)](http://www.fsktm.um.edu.my/) of [Universiti Malaya (UM)](https://www.um.edu.my/), Malaysia.

In this course, we will be learning the basics of programming using `Java` language. There would be 1 lab for each chapter in this course, and each lab would have some questions for students to try and solve using their coding skills.

This repository stores my solutions for lab classes throughout this course.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains multiple lab folders, each indicating the lab number. The directory diagram below shows the structure in each folder:

```
Lab #
 ├─ L#Q#.java
 ├─ L#Q#.java
 ├─ L#Q#.java
 ├─ Question.pdf
 └─ README.md
```

The `Lab #` parent folder refers to the lab number.

* `Lab 01` refers to the Lab #1 in this course.

The file `L#Q#.java` refers to a solution using `Java` for one question in the lab. There will be multiple numbers of `Java` file depending on the number of questions in the lab.

* `L1Q2.java` refers to the solution for Lab **1**, Question **2**.

The file `Question.pdf` stores the original lab question. Feel free to refer to this file to understand the question for each lab solutions.

The file `README.md` documents some of the key takeaways in this lab. However, it might not be present all the time.

> **Note**
